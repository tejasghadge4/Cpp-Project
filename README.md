Generic Data Structure Library.

This Project is considered as a library which contains generic implementation of all major types of data structure.

We Provide the readymade implementations of all fundamental operations as well as advanced operations on linear, non linear data structures in an object oriented way.

We provide the generic way of implementation so we can use the functionality for any type of data type.

All the object oriented design policies are used in this project.
